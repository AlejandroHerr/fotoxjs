fotoxjs is a webapp to display your photography. Build on top of react, it features your pictures inside an horizontal scroller (that responde to mouse, mouse-wheel and touch events).

I'm coding it for my personal use, but if you want to give it try, use it, fork it or whatever, feel free.

It's still a work in progress, it lacks a menu and a proper navigaton system, but the scroller is fully functional (only needs some polishing).
